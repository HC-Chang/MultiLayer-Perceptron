# Multiple-Layer Perceptron
Using Java Swing to implement backpropagation neural network. Learning algorithm can refer to this Wikipedia page.

Input consists of several groups of multi-dimensional data set, The data were cut into three parts (each number roughly equal to the same group), 2/3 of the data given to training function, and the remaining 1/3 of the data given to testing function.

The purpose of program is training to cut a number of groups of hyperplanes and synaptic weights, and display the results in the graphical interface.
