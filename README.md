# Multiple-Layer Perceptron
Using C# to implement multiple layer perceptron.

The dataset consists of multi-dimensional input sample set and ground truth set, The sample set will be given to training function to predict the ground truth set.

The purpose of program is training to cut a number of groups of shifting biases and synaptic(scaling) weights, and display the results in the graphical interface.
